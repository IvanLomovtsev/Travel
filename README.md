# Travel
----------------------
Travel is a JS / FE Pre-School 2022Q2 course from The Rolling Scopes task during which I designed the landing page of a travel planning site, made it adaptive and interactive.
### Key skills I gained during this assignment:
* valid semantic sensitivity layout;
* easy to maintain readable code;
* export styles and graphics from Figma;
* using JavaScript to implement the given functionality.
### Stages of work on the project:
1. I've rendered pages according to the layout in [Figma](https://clck.ru/xfEvW/ "Travel layout"), which is correctly displayed at a screen width of at least 1440px;
2. I added adaptability to the layout page;
3. I added an interactivity page using JavaScript: a slider in the "Popular Destinations" section and animated the Login button after clicking which should appear Login pop up and which will contain the form;
